/* üß† Problem in simple words

On Day 1 ‚Üí only 1 person knows the secret.

Each person can start telling others after delay days.

Each person will forget the secret after forget days.

You need to find ‚Üí on Day n, how many people still remember the secret.

‚ö° Important: Since the number can get huge, return the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.

üèÉ Idea (step-by-step)

Let‚Äôs keep track of how many people learn the secret each day ‚Üí dp[day].

Example: dp[3] = 5 means 5 new people learned the secret on Day 3.

Base case: On Day 1, dp[1] = 1.

For each new day:

People who became eligible to share today ‚Üí add them to the ‚Äúsharers‚Äù group.

People who forgot today ‚Üí remove them from the ‚Äúsharers‚Äù group.

The number of new learners today = total current sharers.

At the end, count everyone who hasn‚Äôt forgotten yet on Day n. */
